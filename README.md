# GTSB
GTSB, made from scratch in HTML, JS, & CSS, was made in under 2 hours. This project will only be worked on if it gains traction or I decide to update it, but feel free to fork it and make it your own.
# Download
Just download source from GitHub as a .zip file and extract. The shortcut inside (Gorilla Tag SoundBoard) can be moved anywhere and just links back to sb.html.
# Customization
You can change the backgrounds as well if you want, or even replace the sounds. If you want to change the sounds, then right click sb.html > Edit In Notepad. Go to line 100 to edit the names & mp3 files.
