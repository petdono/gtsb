GTSB, made from scratch in HTML, JS, & CSS, was made in under 2 hours. This project will only be worked on if it gains traction or I decide to update it, but feel free to fork it and make it your own. Designed to run on a light browser, routed to [VoiceMeeter Banana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) or [VAC](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm), then changing your input to VoiceMeeter on SteamVR. Alternatively, you could play the audio from your phone if you can open html files. I personally tape my phone to my chest and run [SpaceDesk](https://www.spacedesk.net/) on my PC and phone so I can click the buttons while in-game. Don't expect this to get any better, it was a quick and dirty solution to my problem with DCSB and VoiceMod.
# Download
Just download source from GitHub as a .zip file and extract. The shortcut inside (Gorilla Tag SoundBoard) can be moved anywhere and just links back to sb.html.
# Customization
You can change the backgrounds as well if you want, or even replace the sounds. If you want to change the sounds, then right click sb.html > Edit In Notepad. Go to line 100 to edit the names & mp3 files.
